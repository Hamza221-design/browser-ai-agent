Analyze the following HTML {element_type} elements and generate comprehensive test cases.
Focus ONLY on these specific test types: {test_types}

HTML Content:
{html_chunk}

Generate 3-5 test cases, distributing them across the requested test types.
For each test type, create focused tests:

- functional: Test basic functionality and user interactions
- validation: Test input validation, constraints, and data integrity
- negative: Test error conditions, edge cases, and failure scenarios
- positive: Test successful scenarios and expected behaviors
- error_handling: Test error responses, recovery mechanisms, and graceful degradation
- performance: Test loading times, responsiveness, and resource usage
- security: Test authentication, authorization, and data protection

Provide JSON response:
[
    {{
        "title": "Descriptive test case title",
        "description": "Clear description of what is being tested",
        "expected_behavior": "Expected outcome when test passes",
        "test_steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"],
        "element_type": "{element_type}",
        "test_type": "one_of_requested_types",
        "chunk_number": {chunk_num}
    }}
]

Note: The HTML chunk will be added to each test case automatically.

Ensure each test case focuses on the specific test type requested and includes the HTML chunk for reference.
