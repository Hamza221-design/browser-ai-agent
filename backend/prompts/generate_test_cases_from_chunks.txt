Based on the user requirements and HTML content, generate {chunk_test_count} comprehensive test cases.

User Requirements: {requirements}
Target URL: {url}
Element Type: {element_type}
HTML Content:
{html_content}

**Important Guidelines**
- Generate exactly {chunk_test_count} test cases
- Create well defined test cases that are necessary for the user requirements
- Focus on the most important scenarios for {element_type} elements
- Test element visibility, interactivity, and basic functionality
- DO NOT assume navigation to new pages unless explicitly required
- For links: Test if they exist and are clickable, not necessarily navigation
- For forms: Test form validation and submission, not redirects
- For buttons: Test if they're clickable and respond to interaction
- Use realistic expectations based on the HTML content provided

**Test Case Types:**
- functional: Test basic functionality and interaction
- validation: Test form validation and error handling
- negative: Test error scenarios and edge cases
- positive: Test successful scenarios
